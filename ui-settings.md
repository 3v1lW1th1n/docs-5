*Storage* defines the upload folder for media files.

Set a *Cache mode* (*Auto* will choose the most sensible mode).

Developers can enable debug mode (display exceptions with details - disable this in production environments), a debug toolbar (displayed at the bottom of the screen) or choose to disable cache.
