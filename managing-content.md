# Managing content

There are two ways of adding content to your website in Pagekit: static pages or dynamic blog content. You can expand and enrich both of these content types with widgets.

## Using the markdown editor

Before we look at the different content types you can create and manage, let's introduce you to the the main editing tool you will see in all places: Pagekit's powerful markdown editor.

To edit content, you can write HTML with some autocompletion aid or use the popular [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). You can even include HTML snippets in markdown. As you create your content on the left, you will see a real-time preview of the final output on the right. To define how the content is rendered, you can *enable* or *disable* markdown in the settings above the editor.

The editor's toolbar supports you with common markdown elements and allows you to choose text styles, insert links, quotes, lists and media elements.

To insert an image, just click the image icon and a placeholder area will appear in the content preview. Hover over the placeholder and click on the *Settings* button. A modal will appear where you can choose a picture or drag and drop the desired image file from your local file browser.

### Step 3: Updated settings for your chosen image

Adding videos or other binary files works just the same - and when you've inserted your files you can always go to the *Settings* dialog again.

Links have a little pencil icon that you can click to call up the settings panel - either select the link's destination or manually enter a URL.

## Pages

Pages are basically the equivalent to a static webpage. They live outside the blog context, meaning that they aren't thought of as being published at one specific date. Typically you would use pages for content that rarely changes, like your homepage, an *about us*, your contact page or anything that doesn't feel like an article living in a certain category.

A slug is a computer friendly version of the title so that it can be included in the absolute URL to the page. If you do not like the generated slug, simply click on it to choose your own.

By default, the page is *unpublished*. When you are done creating the content and saving the page, click the red *unpublished* label to publish the page.

Page settings are available from the overview - or from the single page edit view.

## Blog

As opposed to pages, *blog posts* appear in chronological order and include a comment section. Posts can be logically organized thanks to Pagekitâ€™s flexible taxonomy.

The basic concepts of slug and the published/unpublished state are the same as with static pages. In addition, a blog post has a published date that can be changed and a comments section that you can moderate and manage.

## Widgets

Widgets are a way to render small chunks of content in areas defined by the theme you are using. A widget's content is either static (like some custom HTML, a logo or a copyright message) or dynamic (like a slideshow generated by one of your installed extensions).

In the *Widgets* overview you see widgets sorted by the position they are published in. Note that only positions are displayed that have a widget published on at least one page - your theme might provide more positions than you can see.

Use drag and drop to move an entry to another position or to change the rendering order inside a position which has several widgets. Toggle between enabled and published state by clicking the red or green circle on the *Status* column.

Pagekit comes with the pre-defined widget types *Login*, *Menu* and *Text*, extensions can add more widget types to this list.

When editing a widget, you will have the *Settings* tab selected by default. Its content depends on the type of the widget. For a text widget you will have a content editing area, for a menu widget options to select a menu and so on.
Every widget type has a set of options available on the right side where you can enable/disable the widget and assign it to a widget position in your theme.

The *Assignment* tab allows you to choose which pages the widget will be rendered on. Alternatively you can use simple patterns to match URLs where you want to display the wdidget. You can insert one pattern per line. Use the "\*" character as a wildcard and exclude pages by prepending an exclamation mark to the path. Example paths: `blog` for the blog page, `blog/*` for blog entries or `!blog` if you want to exclude the blog.

The *Theme* tab includes configuration settings for the Widget's appearance. Choose a panel style (like a box around the widget's content), add a badge and choose to center the widget's content. Note that these settings are specific to your activated theme.
