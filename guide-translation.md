# How to create a translation

<p class="uk-article-lead">We work with Transifex. Itâ€˜s a simple and easy platform where you can share language files to work together on translations.</p>

Feel free to join the official [Pagekit project](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/) on Transifex. After a fast [sign up](http://www.transifex.com/signup/) you can help correct existing translations or add your own language.

## Contribute to an existing translation

If you would like to improve or complete an existing translation, go to the [Pagekit project](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/) on Transifex and choose the language you want to contribute to. You will then see all extentions as *Resources* that can be translated:

| Extention    | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Blog         | This is the translation for the Blog extention |
| Installer    | This is the translation for the Installer extention |
| Page         | This is the translation for the Page extention |
| System       | This is the translation for the System extention |

For any translation steps in the Pagekit project you must first click the *Join team* button which you can find in every language folder on the right side to get access to the language team. We need to approve your contribution so that you are a member of the team and allowed to translate the project.

Choose the resource you want to contribute to by clicking it. A window opens which shows you all options. By clicking *Translate now* you will come to Transifex's editor which allows you to translate directly without down- and uploading any files.

## Request a language

If your language is not listed you can add a new language to the project. Therefore go to the [Pagekit project](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/) on Transifex and add a new language by clicking the button on the right side *Request language*. We will then get notified and will review and approve your added language.

After we approved your request you will then have two options:

### Start the translation in Transifex's editor

If your requested language was approved you can start to translate the extentions, in Transifex called *Resources*. Therefore just click the resource you want to work on and press the button *Translate now*. The Transifex editor opens immediately where you can start to translate without loading any files.

### Upload a .po file
In case you already created a .po language file you can upload your .po file easily by clicking on the resource and *Upload file*.

A green bar in each column shows you the completeness of a translation.
