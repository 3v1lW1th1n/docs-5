# How to create a translation

<p class="uk-article-lead">We work with Transifex. It‘s a simple and easy platform where you can share language files to work together on translations.</p>

Feel free to [join the official Pagekit translation project on Transifex](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/). After a fast [sign up](http://www.transifex.com/signup/) you can help correct existing translations or add your own language.

## Tutorial: How to add a new language?

Go to the [Pagekit project on Transifex](http://www.transifex.com/organization/pagekit/) and add a new language by clicking on „Request language“. We will then get notified and will review and approve your added language. 
Before uploading your language file you must first click the „Join team“ button to get access to the language folder. Again we need to approve your contribution.

After you‘ve got access, you can just go to the folder and choose one of the following „Resources“ that you want to add your language to:

1. Blog
2. Installer
3. Page
4. System

Upload your .po file easily by clicking on the resource and „Upload file“.

A green bar in each column shows you the completeness of a translation.

## Tutorial: How to contribute to an existing translation?
