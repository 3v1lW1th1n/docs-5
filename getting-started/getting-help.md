# Getting Help

Although we have done our best to document as much as possible, it is inevitable that there will be unanswered questions. In order to be as accessible as possible we have several methods to reach the developers and get direct help:

## Gitter

Gitter.im is a great chat tool tightly coupled with GitHub so you will need to create a free GitHub account if you don't already have one. Once done, you can access the chat through the https://gitter.im/pagekit/pagekit URL or you can download one of their [apps](https://gitter.im/apps).

## Github Issues

If you find a bug, have a general question, or even if you want to contribute to the project, you can use the [Pagekit GitHub Issues tracker](https://github.com/pagekit/pagekit/issues).

## Twitter

By [following us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pagekit) you will get a real-time way for us to reach to you, and other followers, about news and events related to Pagekit development.

## Google+

Our [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/104125443335488004107) is very active and its the perfect place to learn and share about Pagekit.

## Pagekit Blog

You can join in a discussion on any of the topics we post about on the [Pagekit Blog](http://pagekit.com/blog), via the comments. We will post all major news and information to our blog, as well as useful posts about development in general.
