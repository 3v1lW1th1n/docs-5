# Updating

<p class="uk-article-lead">Before you perform an update, make sure you have a backup of the current Pagekit installation and your database. That way you can always recover previous states of your installation in case something goes wrong.</p>

## 1-Click Update

You can update Pagekit using the update function in Pagekit's Administration. Open *Settings > Update* and click the *Update* button.

## Manual Update

To update Pagekit manually, download the latest release from http://pagekit.com and extract the archive.
Now upload the folder to your webserver and overwrite the existing files in the Pagekit folder.

To make sure that the update was successful, just open *Settings > Info*. If everything went smoothly, you should see the new version number under the *System* tab.
