# Updating

<p class="uk-article-lead">Before you perform an update, make sure you have a backup of the current Pagekit installation and your database. That way you can always recover previous states of your installation in case something goes wrong.</p>

The recommended way for updating Pagekit is through its Administration. Open *System > Update* and click the *Update* button. To make sure that the update was successful, just open *System > Info*. If everything went smoothly, you should see the new version number under the *System* tab.

**Note**: is possible to update Pagekit manually, although is not recommended. To do so download the latest release from http://pagekit.com and extract the archive. Then upload the folder to your webserver and overwrite the existing files in the Pagekit folder. A database update (if present) is triggered after login to the administrator panel.
