# Menus

This is the place where you manage the site's menus. You can see an overview of all menus on the left and their pending items on the right. Hover over a single entry to see an edit and remove button for that menu.

Items can be arranged quickly via drag-and drop. Click the green or red circle in the status column to enable or disable a menu item.

When setting an item's URL, you need to choose a link type. Pagekit comes with a few pre-defined ones - any extension can add new types to that list. Choose the *divider* type to use the item as a simple visual divider between items, the other types are actual links. Some types require a second choice (like picking a certain page for the *Page* type).

**Note** The *Access* property only controls the visibility of the menu item. If you want to limit accessibility to a certain access group, you have to set the according property at the actual content item.
