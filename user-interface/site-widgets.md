## Site Widgets

Widgets are a way to render small chunks of content in areas defined by the theme you are using. A widget's content is either static (like some custom HTML, a logo or a copyright message) or dynamic (like a slideshow generated by one of your installed extensions).

In the *Site > Widgets* overview the widgets are sorted by the position they are published in, you can Drag & Drop them to change the rendering order inside a position which has several widgets. Toggle between enabled and published state by clicking the red or green circle on the *Status* column. When one or more widgets are selected a toolbar will be revealed allowing to change it state, duplicate it, move it to another position or delete it. It's also possible to filter the currently displayed widgets by clicking on the search icon and inputing the filter criteria.

**Note** Be careful when deleting the Widgets as there is no trash to recover them once deleted.

Pagekit comes with the pre-defined widget types *Menu*, *Text* and *Login*, extensions can add widget types of their own.

## Editing

To edit a widget click on its name, the *Settings* tab will be selected by default in the edit view. The content of the tab will depend on the widget type. For example for a text widget you will have a content editing area, for a menu widget options to select a menu and so on. Every widget type has a set of options available on the right side where you can enable or disable the widget, assign it to a widget position in your theme and restrict its access.

The *Theme* tab includes configuration settings for the widget's appearance. You can choose a panel style (like a box around the widget's content) or add a badge and center the widget's content. Note that these settings are specific to your activated theme.

The *Visibility* tab allows you to choose which pages the widget will be rendered on.
