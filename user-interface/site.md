# Site
<p class="uk-article-lead">This is the place where you manage the site's menus and pages, structured in a tree view for easy managing.</p>

## Menus
You can see an overview of all menus on the left and their pending pages on the right. Hover a single entry to see an _edit_ and _remove_ button for that menu. New menus can be created by clicking on the _Add Menu_ button.

Each menu linked pages are displayed on the right. Pages without a menu are listed in the _Not Linked_ view, while trashed pages are listed in the _Trash_ view, both accessible below the menus list.

## Pages
Menu pages can be managed on the right list. They can be sorted quickly via drag-and drop or disabled/enabled by clicking on the green or red circle in the status column. When one or more pages are selected through the checkboxes a toolbar will appear allowing to to perform additional batch tasks as changing the state, moving the pages to another menu or deleting them.

To create a new page click on the _Add Page_ top right button and choose the type of page you are willing to create. Pagekit comes with a few pre-defined ones - any extension can add new types to that list.

### Type Pages
Pages are basically the equivalent to a static webpage. They live outside the blog context, meaning that they aren't thought of as being published at one specific date. Typically you would use pages for content that rarely changes, like an _About Us_, _Contact_ page or anything that doesn't feel like an article living in a certain category.

In the **Content** tab you can edit the page main content, such as the article body, title and slug. Additionally you can set the Menu title which will be displayed in the frontend Menu list, the page status, access and linked menu. The **Settings** tab will display an overview of the page basic settings. Finally, the **Theme** tab holds the theme specific options.

**Note** A slug is a computer friendly version of the title so that it can be included in the absolute URL to the page. If you do not like the generated slug, simply click on it to choose your own.

### Type Link
Links are the most flexible type as they can create a menu entry linking to any internal or external URL.

![Link Picker](assets/site-link-1.png)

In the **Settings** tab the URL field allows inputting manually the value or use the assistant by clicking the _select_ button. The URL assistant allows choosing the extension and view which you are willing to link to. The link type field allows choosing if the link should be a normal link, an alias of another link or a redirect.

**Note** Changing the link type could affect your site SEO, leave it to default _link_ if you are not sure what it is about.

As in page type the tabs **Settings** and **Theme** offers an overview of basic settings and theme specific ones respectively.

## Widgets
Widgets are a way to render small chunks of content in areas defined by the theme you are using. A widget's content is either static (like some custom HTML, a logo or a copyright message) or dynamic (like a slideshow generated by one of your installed extensions).

![widgets overview](assets/site-widgets.png)

In the _Site > Widgets_ overview the widgets are sorted by the position they are published in, you can Drag & Drop them to change the rendering order inside a position which has several widgets. Toggle between enabled and published state by clicking the red or green circle on the _Status_ column. When one or more widgets are selected a toolbar will be revealed allowing to change it state, duplicate it, move it to another position or delete it. It's also possible to filter the currently displayed widgets by clicking on the search icon and inputing the filter criteria.

**Note** Be careful when deleting the Widgets as there is no trash to recover them once deleted.

Pagekit comes with the pre-defined widget types _Menu_, _Text_ and _Login_, extensions can add widget types of their own.

### Editing
To edit a widget click on its name, the _Settings_ tab will be selected by default in the edit view. The content of the tab will depend on the widget type. For example for a text widget you will have a content editing area, for a menu widget options to select a menu and so on. Every widget type has a set of options available on the right side where you can enable or disable the widget, assign it to a widget position in your theme and restrict its access.

![Edit a widget](assets/site-widget-edit.png)

The _Theme_ tab includes configuration settings for the widget's appearance. You can choose a panel style (like a box around the widget's content) or add a badge and center the widget's content. Note that these settings are specific to your activated theme.

The _Visibility_ tab allows you to choose which pages the widget will be rendered on.
