# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first thing you see when entering the Pagekit administration panel. All information you find here, e.g. statistics on your siteâ€™s activity, comes from widgets configured by the user - each user's dashboard can look different.

It is up to you what information you want to have displayed here. To manage which widgets are being displayed, they configuration and order they appear in, go to *System > Dashboard*.
