# Marketplace

<p class="uk-article-lead">Find official and third party extensions and themes and install them with one click.</p>

## Browse available packages

The Marketplace is divided into a section for extensions and one for themes. You can navigate between those using the tabs at the top of the interface.

## Install a package

When clicking on the preview of each extension or theme a modal window will open that contains further information on the product. Just hit the _Install_ button in the upper right corner. Make sure to **activate** the package afterwards in the _System_ section of the Pagekit administration.
