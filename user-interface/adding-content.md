ADDING CONTENT

There are several ways of creating the actual content of your website. Usually you will have one or more articles as the core of your page and different widgets to complete the page’s layout. These articles can either be static pages or dynamic blog posts.

Pages
Basically Pages are nothing other than static web pages. They work outside any blog context and are less time-bound as they’re not ordered chronically. This makes them great for content that rarely changes like your homepage, the about or contact page etc.

Blog
Blog posts are displayed in chronological order and different from pages, users can comment on blog posts. You can organize your posts into different categories and tag them. Pagekit’s taxonomy is comparatively flexible, allowing you to apply more than one category to a post.

Widgets
You can expand your content by using widgets - components that render small chunks of content. Pagekit has a number of pre-defined positions, to which widgets are published in order to determine, where in your site they will be rendered.

HTML/Markdown editor
To edit your content you can use HTML and/or Markdown. Pagekit provides a clever editor with real-time preview. You write your content on the left and can immediately see the result on the right side.
The editor includes a toolbar to improve your workflow by letting you easily insert links, lists, quotes and media. For example, by clicking on the image icon inside the toolbar, a placeholder area will be inserted into your content. Then you can just drag and drop your image into the area to upload it.

Every object can be modified through a settings panel. Just hover the object,
